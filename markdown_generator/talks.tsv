A Mixture of Personalized Experts for Human Affect Estimation	Talk	personalized-experts	International Conference in Machine Learning and Data Mining (MLDM)	2018-07-19	"Newark, New Jersey"		"We investigate the personalization of deep convolutional neural networks for facial expression analysis from still images. While prior work has focused on population-based (``one-size-fits-all'') approaches, we formulate and construct personalized models via a mixture of experts and supervised domain adaptation approach, showing that it improves greatly upon non-personalized models. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of the model personalization to quickly and effectively adapt to limited amounts of target data. We also provide a novel training methodology and architecture for creating personalized machine learning models for more effective analysis of emotion state."
An Empirical Study of Modular Bias Mitigators and Ensembles	Talk	empirical-study	Workshop on Benchmarking Data for Data-Centric AI (DataPerf@ICML)	2022-07-22	"Baltimore, MD"	https://slideslive.com/38986356/an-empirical-study-of-modular-bias-mitigators-and-ensembles	"Bias mitigators can reduce algorithmic bias in machine learning models, but their effect on fairness is often not stable across different data splits. A popular approach to train more stable models is ensemble learning. We built an open-source library enabling the modular composition of 10 mitigators, 4 ensembles, and their corresponding hyperparameters. We empirically explored the space of combinations on 13 datasets and distilled the results into a guidance diagram for practitioners."
