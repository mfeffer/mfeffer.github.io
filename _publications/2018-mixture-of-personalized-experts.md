excerpt: 'We investigate the personalization of deep convolutional neural networks for facial expression analysis from still images. While prior work has focused on population-based (“one-size-fits-all”) approaches, we formulate and construct personalized models via a mixture of experts and supervised domain adaptation approach, showing that it improves greatly upon non-personalized models.'

We investigate the personalization of deep convolutional neural networks for facial expression analysis from still images. While prior work has focused on population-based (“one-size-fits-all”) approaches, we formulate and construct personalized models via a mixture of experts and supervised domain adaptation approach, showing that it improves greatly upon non-personalized models.
