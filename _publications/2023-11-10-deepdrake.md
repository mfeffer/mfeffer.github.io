excerpt: 'In this paper, we investigate two leading sources of musical deepfake models, the AI Hub Discord server and the Uberduck website, which are dedicated to the training, utilization, and distribution of these deepfakes. Interestingly, musical deepfakes target hundreds of artists of different backgrounds, levels of success, and musical styles. In light of the economic, legal, and ethical issues raised by deepfakes of so many artists, we provide warnings about the generation of discriminatory forms of content and potential financial and contractual problems for artists. We recommend more research should be conducted in this area, especially to probe peoples&apos; perceptions of this technology and devise approaches that mitigate potential harms.'

In this paper, we investigate two leading sources of musical deepfake models, the AI Hub Discord server and the Uberduck website, which are dedicated to the training, utilization, and distribution of these deepfakes. Interestingly, musical deepfakes target hundreds of artists of different backgrounds, levels of success, and musical styles. In light of the economic, legal, and ethical issues raised by deepfakes of so many artists, we provide warnings about the generation of discriminatory forms of content and potential financial and contractual problems for artists. We recommend more research should be conducted in this area, especially to probe peoples&apos; perceptions of this technology and devise approaches that mitigate potential harms.
