2018-06-08	Personalized machine learning for facial expression analysis	MIT EECS Department	"For this MEng Thesis Project, I investigated the personalization of deep convolutional networks for facial expression analysis."

Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2018."	personalized-machine-learning	https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/119763/1078783584-MIT.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y
2018-07-15	A Mixture of Personalized Experts for Human Affect Estimation	MLDM	"We investigate the personalization of deep convolutional neural networks for facial expression analysis from still images. While prior work has focused on population-based (“one-size-fits-all”) approaches, we formulate and construct personalized models via a mixture of experts and supervised domain adaptation approach, showing that it improves greatly upon non-personalized models."

2022-12-08	Assistive Alignment of In-The-Wild Sheet Music and Performances	ISMIR LBD	"We developed an interactive system, MeSA, which leverages off-the-shelf measure and beat detection software to aid musicians in quickly producing measure-level alignments (ones which map bounding boxes of measures in the sheet music to timestamps in the performance audio). We verified MeSA's functionality by using it to create a small proof of-concept dataset, MeSA-13."	"Feffer, M., Donahue, C., & Lipton, Z. (2022, December).

2023-02-12	Moral Machine or Tyranny of the Majority?	AAAI	"In this paper, we analyze the mechanism of averaging preference vectors across a population, focusing on stability, strategic effects, and implications for fairness."

2023-08-08	From Preference Elicitation to Participatory ML: A Critical Survey & Guidelines for Future Research	AIES	"We critically examine the leap from structured preference elicitation to participatory design for value alignment. Through an extensive literature review and comparative analysis of several existing methods, we outline ten axes along which participation (by non-technical stakeholders) should be evaluated."

2023-08-01	A Suite of Fairness Datasets for Tabular Classification.	arXiv	"We introduce a suite of functions for fetching 20 fairness datasets and providing associated fairness metadata. Hopefully, these will lead to more rigorous experimental evaluations in future fairness-aware machine learning research."	Hirzel, M. & Feffer, M. (2023).

2023-09-12	Searching for Fairer Machine Learning Ensembles	AutoML	"Bias mitigators can improve algorithmic fairness in machine learning models, but their effect on fairness is often not stable across data splits. A popular approach to train more stable models is ensemble learning, but unfortunately, it is unclear how to combine ensembles with mitigators to best navigate trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance. To that end, we extended the open-source library Lale to enable the modular composition of 8 mitigators, 4 ensembles, and their corresponding hyperparameters, and we empirically explored the space of configurations on 13 datasets."

2023-10-30	"The AI Incident Database as an Educational Tool to Raise Awareness of Harms: A Classroom Exploration of Efficacy, Limitations, & Future Design Improvements"	EAAMO	"We provide evidence suggesting that one of the critical objectives of AI Ethics education must be to raise awareness of AI harms. While there are various sources to learn about such harms, The AI Incident Database (AIID) is one of the few attempts at offering a relatively comprehensive database indexing prior instances of harms or near harms stemming from the deployment of AI technologies in the real world. This study assesses the effectiveness of AIID as an educational tool to raise awareness regarding the prevalence and severity of AI harms in socially high-stakes domains. We present findings obtained through a classroom study conducted at an R1 institution as part of a course focused on the societal and ethical considerations around AI and ML."
