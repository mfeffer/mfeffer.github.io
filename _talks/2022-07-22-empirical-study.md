Bias mitigators can reduce algorithmic bias in machine learning models, but their effect on fairness is often not stable across different data splits. A popular approach to train more stable models is ensemble learning. We built an open-source library enabling the modular composition of 10 mitigators, 4 ensembles, and their corresponding hyperparameters. We empirically explored the space of combinations on 13 datasets and distilled the results into a guidance diagram for practitioners.
