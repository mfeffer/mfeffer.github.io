title: "Assistive Alignment of In-The-Wild Sheet Music and Performances"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-12-08-mesa
excerpt: 'We developed an interactive system, MeSA, which leverages off-the-shelf measure and beat detection software to aid musicians in quickly producing measure-level alignments (ones which map bounding boxes of measures in the sheet music to timestamps in the performance audio). We verified MeSA&apos;s functionality by using it to create a small proof of-concept dataset, MeSA-13.'
