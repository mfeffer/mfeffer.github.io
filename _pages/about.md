I am a second-year [Societal Computing](https://sc.cs.cmu.edu/) PhD student in the [Institute for Software Research](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to coming to CMU, I graduated from MIT in 2018 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and a Master of Engineering (MEng) degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Industry positions include:

* software engineering summer intern at IMC Financial Markets on a fullstack web development project (React, Go, and MongoDB)
* full-time software engineer at Mastercard Data & Services for 2.5 years on projects ranging from fullstack web development (React, C# .NET, and SQL Server) to analytic research (R and Python).
* summer research intern at IBM Research in AI Engineering (Python)

Research
======
I am broadly interested in applying AI and machine learning techniques to problems in the humanities and social sciences. To that end, as an undergrad at MIT, I worked at [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) on handwritten digit recognition technology with the end goal of detecting mental illnesses like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, and for my MEng degree, I worked in the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) on building models to estimate emotions from facial images, which in turn can eventually be used in a myriad of different ways (including but not limited to assessing engagement or detecting conditions like anxiety and depression). Currently, my primary areas of research are:

* algorithmic fairness
* music information retrieval
* participatory machine learning
* social good applications of AI and ML
* sustainability
