While at MIT, I served as a course lecturer’s assistant (LA) for one semester for an intro to machine learning class taught with flipped classroom style. My obligations included going over the material for each week at a weekly staff meeting, writing solutions for homework problems, assisting students as they went through problems during class hours, and ensuring that students grasped the understanding of key concepts with checkoff questions. The following semester, I served as a teacher’s assistant (TA) for the same class. I had the same obligations as before but was required to invest more time, plus I was additionally responsible for proctoring and grading exams as well as responding to student questions online.
